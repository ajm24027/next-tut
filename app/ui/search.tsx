// Debouncing is a programming practice that limits the rate at which a function can fire. In our case, you only want to query the database when the user has stopped typing.

// Trigger Event: When an event that should be debounced (like a keystroke in the search box) occurs, a timer starts.
// Wait: If a new event occurs before the timer expires, the timer is reset.
// Execution: If the timer reaches the end of its countdown, the debounced function is executed.

// By debouncing, you can reduce the number of requests sent to your database, thus saving resources.
